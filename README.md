## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a motivated junior developer with hands-on experience in modern web technologies, including React, Next.js, JavaScript, and C#. I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-focused web applications.

I have worked on both individual and team-based projects, including a 36-hour game development hackathon where I led a team and collaborated under time pressure.

I am continuously improving my skills and looking for opportunities to grow as a frontend or full-stack developer.
